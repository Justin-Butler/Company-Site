# Company-Site
First Corporate Website - Portfolio
This is my first site after learning HTML and CSS for 7 months now. I used Bootstrap 4 and CSS Grid to build this site. Javascript is only included on the Registration page.

The webpage is fully responsive utilizing the Card, Carousel, and Dropdown Components of Bootstrap 4. The Home page and the article page use strictly HTML and CSS. The registration page utilizes JQuery for form validation. Additional Detail on the Registration page can be found here: https://github.com/Justin-Butler/JS_Form_Validation
